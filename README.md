# TGstalker
I was tired of stalking people by hand, so I wrote a script for this.
### Dependencies:
pipenv(selenium, python3)
### Usage:
```sh
pipenv run python main.py 123456
```
where 123456 is target telegram user id. You can get it if you open a dialogue like https://web.telegram.org/a/#123456

Logs will be saved to 123456.log.
Should open login window when using the script for the first time.

Plotting and getting use of ambigious telegram statuses will come soon.
